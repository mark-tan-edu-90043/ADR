## Data Storage

### Status

Proposed.

### Decision

In order to support the app's needs, a database solution will likely be made use of, such as MySQL or Oracle. On the other hand, the app will have to make use of a client device's own storage to support offline functions and native image formatting solutions. Other solutions such as MongoDB may allow for more simplified, easier storage of information.

### Context and Considerations

* The retail company wishes to track behaviour, purchases and loyalty program functions
* As a retail application, deliveries, order histories, product inventories and similar have to be managed.

### Rationale and Consequences

The application will make extensive use of databasing software in order to keep track of customer data, purchase records, inventory and so forth. Having powerful database software will make this process not just easy, but intuitive and expandable.
