## Additional Frameworks

### Status

Proposed.

### Decision

The application will also make extensive use of services such as **PayPal**, **Google Analytics**, **Amazon Storage** and **Localization Services** amongst other, similar solutions.

### Context and Considerations

* The application will be internationally used, and localization will be necessary for reaching diverse groups
* The company wishes to track customer behaviour, spending patterns, loyalty and purchases to implement better performance and User Experience
* The app needs to be integrated with various payment gateways, with secure and convenient transactions

### Rationale and consequences

Despite meeting business requirements, these services will likely not be the only ones involved in the app's other connections. These are simply the most prominent and well-known names in the industry, and making use of them will vastly streamline the application's development.
