## Permissions

### Status

Proposed.

### Decision

The app will request the following permissions:

* Location
* Notifications
* Photos and Videos
* Internet
* Nearby Devices

### Context and Considerations

* The application should track users' activities on the app, and will likely factor in their movement to stores and interactions with loyalty programs
* Notifications will be sent to uses whenever an order updates, new products arrive or exclusive offers arise
* The application, while able to function offline, will require some degree of network connectivity
* The app will display product images, which may be compressed and stored on the user's device for offline use.

### Rationale and consequences

The application's permission requests are fairly standard to applications of its type, and meet all business requirements through them. By requesting and allowing these permissions, the app's operation will be considerably streamlined and provide its components with the required information and dexterity within the system.
